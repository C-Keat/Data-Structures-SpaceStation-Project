# Data-Structures-SpaceStation-Project

The overall system is responsible for storing information on different types of rooms inside of a tree data structure, allowing astronauts, with their own data, to be added to selected rooms via a linked list. The system can also sort and store oxygen tanks, in an order that is appropriate for storing them, using a stack we are able to put the fullest in first so that if this was a real-life scenario. The real-life application of this system would be a space station management system, allowing astronauts to check rooms to see information about it like oxygen level and see if there are any crew assigned to that room.
